# Film Preservation
This post offers both condition and preservation history reports that can be used throughout the inspection and preservation process. [Condition Report](https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/pcr_blank.pdf) is based on *NFPF Print Condition Report* to describe physical characteristics of film materials, and one report should only be used for one film reel. The preservation report provides thorough documentation during the digitization process that can later be integrated as part of the [preservation metadata](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/FE_Dappert_Enders_MetadataStds_isqv22no2.pdf).
